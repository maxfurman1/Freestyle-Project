# Freestyle-Project

Welcome to maxfurman1's Freestyle Project!

This application was created for an NYU Intro to Programming Class.

The application will allow users to output stock information after answering a few questions. Give the application a try and let me know how it works for you!

Please run app/stock_price_app.py in order to use this application.

Note: Please make sure to run this program in Python 3!
